JavaScript README
Introduction
JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented programming language. It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and is used in a wide variety of applications, including web development, mobile development, and game development.

This Project
This project is a simple JavaScript library that provides a number of useful functions for working with strings, numbers, and arrays. It is designed to be easy to use and understand, and is well-documented.

Getting Started
To install this project, you can use the following command:

npm install javascript-library

Once the project is installed, you can import it into your JavaScript code using the following syntax:

import { stringFunctions, numberFunctions, arrayFunctions } from 'javascript-library';


## Usage

The following code shows how to use the stringFunctions object to capitalize a string:

const string = 'hello world';
const capitalizedString = stringFunctions.capitalize(string);

console.log(capitalizedString); // 'Hello World'

The following code shows how to use the numberFunctions object to round a number to two decimal places:

const number = 12.3456;
const roundedNumber = numberFunctions.round(number, 2);

console.log(roundedNumber); // 12.35


The following code shows how to use the arrayFunctions object to reverse an array:

const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const reversedArray = arrayFunctions.reverse(array);

console.log(reversedArray); // [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
